<h2><a name="_history"></a>History</h2>
<p>One day, my mom asked me to observe when there is iPhone 4 sale in Apple Store, their online website. You know, China is popular with iPhone 4, so that most of the time the phone is not available. Then I must watch that sale page again and again. That&#8217;s boring, and doesn&#8217;t meet programmer&#8217;s style. So I decided to write one tool help me do this job automatically. That is, Inspector.</p>

<h2><a name="_about_the_logo"></a>About the Logo</h2>
<p>That strange characters you have seen in the logo, people call them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">leet</a>. Leet is an alternative alphabet for the English language that is used primarily on the Internet. The logo&#8217;s meaning is Inspector.</p>

<h2><a name="_inspiration"></a>Inspiration</h2>
<p>In respect of how to show inspect an element in page, I influenced by <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> mostly, even my project&#8217;s name. Firebug is a great work, I also referenced some JavaScript code in it.</p>
<p>I will appreciate <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> and <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/furyu-tei/20090324/BSXPath">BSXPath</a> too. With Beautiful Soup, I could parse bad HTML/XHTML markup comfortable. The Python standard library is also good, but it&#8217;s too strict. BSXPath is an extension for Beautiful Soup, so I can find an element by XPath.</p>
