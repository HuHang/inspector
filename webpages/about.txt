History
-------

One day, my mom asked me to observe when there is iPhone 4 sale in Apple Store, their online website. You know, China is popular with iPhone 4, so that most of the time the phone is not available. Then I must watch that sale page again and again. That's boring, and doesn't meet programmer's style. So I decided to write one tool help me do this job automatically. That is, Inspector.

About the Logo
--------------

That strange characters you have seen in the logo, people call them http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet[leet]. Leet is an alternative alphabet for the English language that is used primarily on the Internet. The logo's meaning is Inspector.

Inspiration
-----------

In respect of how to show inspect an element in page, I influenced by http://getfirebug.com/[Firebug] mostly, even my project's name. Firebug is a great work, I also referenced some JavaScript code in it.

I will appreciate http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/[Beautiful Soup] and http://d.hatena.ne.jp/furyu-tei/20090324/BSXPath[BSXPath] too. With Beautiful Soup, I could parse bad HTML/XHTML markup comfortable. The Python standard library is also good, but it's too strict. BSXPath is an extension for Beautiful Soup, so I can find an element by XPath.

This project is hosted by http://code.google.com/appengine/[Google App Engine]. Thank you, Google guys.
